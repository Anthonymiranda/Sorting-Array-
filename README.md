<h2> Sorting Array School Project Program</h2>
This was a sorting Array that I had to make for a school program. The program was supposed to sort through information according to various instructions.

The process towards the creating of the sorting array is broken up into two parts. First, I broke up the algorithm for Part 1 based on the instructions (which confused me a bit on the ordering). 
<h2> Language Used</h2>
 
  - Python
  
 <h2> Utilities Used</h2>

 - Replit
<h3>Part 1: Sorting Arrays</h3>

1.) Develop a program that asks the user to enter a capital for a U.S. state. 

2). For this application, the 50 states and their capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array in order by state name. 

3.) Upon receiving the user input, the program reports whether the user input is correct. 

4.) Display the current contents of the array then use a bubble sort to sort the content by capital. 

4.) Next, prompt the user to enter answers for all the state capitals and then display the total correct count. The user's answer is not case-sensitive.

And here the replit link for it if you want it(https://replit.com/join/kwkeafjvcb-v6tvm78p7w) 

And here is the Array for the State below: 

              {"Alabama", "Montgomery"},
            {"Alaska", "Juneau"},
            {"Arizona", "Phoenix"},
            {"Arkansas", "Little Rock"},
            {"California", "Sacramento"},
            {"Colorado", "Denver"},
            {"Connecticut", "Hartford"},
            {"Delaware", "Dover"},
            {"Florida", "Tallahassee"},
            {"Georgia", "Atlanta"},
            {"Hawaii", "Honolulu"},
            {"Idaho", "Boise"},
            {"Illinois", "Springfield"},
            {"Indiana", "Indianapolis"},
            {"Iowa", "Des Moines"},
            {"Kansas", "Topeka"},
            {"Kentucky", "Frankfort"},
            {"Louisiana", "Baton Rouge"},
            {"Maine", "Augusta"},
            {"Maryland", "Annapolis"},
            {"Massachusetts", "Boston"},
            {"Michigan", "Lansing"},
            {"Minnesota", "Saint Paul"},
            {"Mississippi", "Jackson"},
            {"Missouri", "Jefferson City"},
            {"Montana", "Helena"},
            {"Nebraska", "Lincoln"},
            {"Nevada", "Carson City"},
            {"New Hampshire", "Concord"},
            {"New Jersey", "Trenton"},
            {"New Mexico", "Santa Fe"},
            {"New York", "Albany"},
            {"North Carolina", "Raleigh"},
            {"North Dakota", "Bismarck"},
            {"Ohio", "Columbus"},
            {"Oklahoma", "Oklahoma City"},
            {"Oregon", "Salem"},
            {"Pennsylvania", "Harrisburg"},
            {"Rhode Island", "Providence"},
            {"South Carolina", "Columbia"},
            {"South Dakota", "Pierre"},
            {"Tennessee", "Nashville"},
            {"Texas", "Austin"},
            {"Utah", "Salt Lake City"},
            {"Vermont", "Montpelier"},
            {"Virginia", "Richmond"},
            {"Washington", "Olympia"},
            {"West Virginia", "Charleston"},
            {"Wisconsin", "Madison"},
            {"Wyoming", "Cheyenne"}
                   };

<h3> Part 2: Sorting & Searching HashMap </h3>
1.) Create a HashMap for the State and their Capitals
        
2). For this application, create a scanner intance to the read the user input of a State and Output its Capital.

3.) Upon receiving the user input, the program reports whether the user input is correct.

4.) Create a loop that keeps asking the user for States. User input should be checked to be correct

5.) Next, prompt the user on how to exit the loop.

The code for this part of the program can be found here:
